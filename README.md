# Importance-Driven Deep Learning System Testing -ICSE 2020

### About
This paper [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3628024.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3628024)
presents DeepImportance, a systematic testing methodology accompanied by an Importance-Driven (IDC)
test adequacy criterion for DL systems. Applying IDC enables to
establish a layer-wise functional understanding of the importance
of DL system components and use this information to guide the
generation of semantically-diverse test sets. Our empirical evalua-
tion on several DL systems, across multiple DL datasets and with
state-of-the-art adversarial generation techniques demonstrates the
usefulness and effectiveness of DeepImportance and its ability to
guide the engineering of more robust DL systems.
